# NC-velp-final-project

<h2>
<strong>Description</strong>
</h2>

Velp is designed to be a platform that connects volunteers with organizations in need of volunteers. It allows volunteers to browse different volunteering opportunities and apply for the ones that interest them. The app also provides a feature for organizations to post their volunteering opportunities and view who signed up to them.

Velp has an minimum age of 16 in order to use and charities must have a registered charity number with the UK government in order to sign up. This is to protect our users who are offering up their grace and free time.
